## Open Project:

**Non-Fungible Samizdat (NFS)** is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) [peer to peer (P2P)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [curatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator) [rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_system) inspired by [samizdat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat) anonymous publications.

## Open Methodology:

1. Users [mint](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/cryptocurrency/minting-crypto) a publication, like in [non-fungible tokens (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), but also deciding its [semantic web ontology (SWO)](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page) [controlled vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary), [metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology), and [monitoring and evaluation (M&E)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitoring_and_evaluation) [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter).
2. The [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) blockchain users rates the publication's distance reached, network size, and preview reviews neutrality while they are paid to identify the author of the work, so generating its rate of anonymity and proof of neutrality. If they can discover the work, it is devalued or even aborted.
3. The reviews ammount and the farthest the work reaches away from the author in the network value it more. A report of the publication's proof of anonymous reach, proof of neutrality, and an overall proof of anonymous content evaluation.

## Open Usages:

- **CryptoCurator** where publications can be anonymously evaluated and have their peer to peer (P2P) anonymous neutrality rated.
- **CryptoCourier** where publications authorship disclosure only occur after it is read or reviewed by a certain number of people from a different world region or who fulfill a specific set of evaluation conditions.
- **OpenCensorship** where communities can establish a set of evaluation parameters to analyze publications value under specific codes of conducts under [open source governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_governance).
